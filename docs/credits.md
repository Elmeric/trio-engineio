Trio-engineio is based on [python-engineio] from Miguel Grinberg.

If you don't need a trio integration or if you need an Engine.IO server, please
use this awesome library!

Trio-Engineio implementation uses these projects: ** Thanks you!**

- [Python], a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems
more effectively.
- [trio], a friendly Python library for async concurrency and I/O.
- [httpcore], the HTTP Core package provides a minimal low-level HTTP client,
which does one thing only. Sending HTTP requests.
- [trio-websocket], a WebSocket implementation for the Trio framework that strives for 
safety, correctness, and ergonomics.
